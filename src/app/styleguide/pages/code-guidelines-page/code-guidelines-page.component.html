  <h1>Code Guidelines</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <p class="main-text">
      The bulk of our styling framework's code consists of custom made components and
       bootstrap overrides. This division of concerns helps keep the code modular and easy
      to maintain. All those components take their styles from a set of predefined themes.
    </p>
    <p class="main-text">
      Our style-guide follows the Atomic Design structure. Our themes consist of maps where the key is
      the property name and the value is the property value.
      which are used to create may different atoms such as buttons and inputs. These many different atoms can be further
      combined
      together to form molecules which are components that put the atoms to good use. These components should be used in
      development
      to keep the platform's design consistent.

    <h3>File Naming</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      All folder, file, and property names in our framework should be singular.
      Style files that are to be imported to the global theme should have the <span class="important-text">'theme'</span>
      subclass added.<br>
      Additionally any files related to components should also have the <span class="important-text">'component'</span> added. <br>
    </p>
    <div class="code-section">
      <code>
        /* Do */
        @import '_card.component.theme.scss';
        @import '_bootstrap.theme.scss';

        /* Don't */
        @import 'card.scss';
        @import 'bootstrap.scss';
      </code>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Theme Combination Naming</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      Keys in theme maps should all be in <span class="important-text">lower-kebab-case</span> meaning that capital letters are never used and words are delimited by
      hyphens.
      And whenever we have multiple keys with the same values, all the keys should reference the very first one
      to avoid redundancy and improve performance.<br>
      Their intuitive design will get all developers familiar with them as quick as possible, with some special classes
      designed
    </p>
    <div class="code-section">
      <code>
        /* Do */
        color-primary: #209e91
        color-secondary-gray: #e5e5e5
        color-text-primary: color-primary-gray

        /* Don't */
        ColorPrimary: #209e91
        ColorSecondaryGray: #e5e5e5
        ColorTextPrimary: #e5e5e5
      </code>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Mixins and Directives</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      All component styles and overrides are applied using mixins. And all components are implemented as shadow DOM
      elements (directives). <br>
      Component style mixin names should begin with <span class="important-text">'nga'</span> followed by the
      component name, and end with <span class="important-text">'theme'</span>.<br>
      Bootstrap overrides mixin names follow the same rules except they also include a <span class="important-text">'b'</span>.<br>
      Finally, all custom component tags should include <span class="important-text">'nga'</span> at the beginning.<br>
      All names are in <span class="important-text">lower-camel-case</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="code-section">
      <code>
        /* Mixins */

        @mixin nga-actions-theme()
        @mixin nga-card-theme()

        @mixin nga-b-accordion-theme()
        @mixin nga-b-button-group-theme()

        /* Directives  */

        &lt;nga-card&gt; &lt;/nga-card&gt;
        &lt;nga-search-field&gt; &lt;/nga-search-field&gt;
      </code>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Applying The Theme</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      Any section of code where the activated theme(s) should be applied must be enclosed inside the nga-layout
      tags. This gives us more control over our styles and view encapsulation.
    </p>
    <div class="code-section">
      <code>
        /* nga-layout */

        &lt;nga-layout&gt;
          &lt;nga-layout-columns&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt; Hello World! &lt;h1&gt;
          &lt;/nga-layout-columns&gt;
        &lt;/nga-layout&gt;
      </code>
