    <p class="intro-text">
      With the expansion of the <a href="https://www.monopolykings.com/welcome">MonopolyKings</a> team on the horizon,
      we thought ahead about our needs as a development team.
      More specifically we wanted to handle scalability in a graceful manner in order to ensure that our platform's
      quality is maintained and it's design consistent.We are building this style-guide to refine and maintain our
      brand
      identity.
      This style-guide consists of a library of tailored UI components, brand guidelines, brand assets, code snippets,
      developer guidelines and more.
      All of MonopolyKings' engineers should abide by these guidelines and are encouraged to constantly add their
      input
      raise new ideas for discussion.
